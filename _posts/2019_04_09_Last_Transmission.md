The challenge is a pretty basic stegano one.

##The Challenge

We're given a big image(larger than our screen) which seems to be gleetch.

![Image normale](/assets/images/Lasttransmission/image_normal.png)

If you've already did some stegano, you have already seen this kind of image. It's basic stegano.

All you need to know, is, thanks to apps like stegsolve, apply filters on the image.

This is the image with a random filter on it :

With the red plane 1 filters you see the flag apper on the top right corner.
